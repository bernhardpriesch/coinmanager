# Coinmanager
Coinamanger is a little tool to maintain your collection of coins. It is possible to enter the coins with detailed information like name, year, fineness, images of the front and back site, estimated value and denomination.
Of course, it is also possible to search for entered coins and to edit them. Furthermore, the value of the collection can be callculated on the current rates of the materials and currencies.
The current rates of the materials and currencies can be edited, so the callculation is always up to date.

Basically it should help to gain again an overview of the collection of coins.
